            7863.The Poor Wit and the Rich Councillor. A certayne
            poor wit, being an-hungered, did meet a well-fed
            councillor.'Marry, fool,' quothe the councillor,
            'whither away?' 'In truth,' said the poor wag, 'in
            that I have eaten naught these two dayes, I do wither
            away, and that right rapidly!' The Councillor laughed
            hugely, and gave him a sausage." Humph! the councillor
            was easier to please than my new master the
            Lieutenant. I would like to take post under that
            councillor. Ah! 'tis but melancholy mumming when poor
            heart-broken, jilted Jack Point must needs turn to
            Hugh Ambrose for original light humour!</p>
